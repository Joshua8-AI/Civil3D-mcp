## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Style lookups by name never matched on Civil 3D 2027, so a requested style
  was silently replaced by the drawing's first one: `create_layout` with style
  "Design Profile" got "Existing Ground Profile", and `view_create` with style
  "Profile View" warned the style was missing. Civil 3D 2027's `StyleBase`
  declares a set-only `Name` that hides the readable base-class `Name`, so the
  reflective name read returned null for every style, label set and band set.
  Names are now read through the documented `DBObject.Name`, and the
  reflection boundary resolves a readable (or writable) declaration when a
  derived class hides one. A style, label set or band set name that does not
  exist is now `CIVIL3D.INVALID_INPUT` listing the available names instead of
  a silent substitution. No name still means the drawing's first one, except
  the section view band set and group plot style lookups, which pass Civil
  3D's default (a null id), and the profile view band set lookup, which uses
  the first band set only where the caller asks for it (`view_create` does).
  `create_layout` / `create_from_surface` now report the style and layer
  applied. Affects every `LookupUtils` style lookup (alignment, profile,
  surface, alignment/profile label set, profile view style and band set,
  parcel style, parcel area label style, section view style and band set,
  group plot style) and the name reads in the label and pipe-network style
  lookups.
- `civil3d_plot` plot/publish: with a PDF device set to "open in viewer when
  done", the viewer opened the hidden `.<name>.<guid>.mcp-tmp.pdf` the plotter
  had been pointed at, which had already been renamed to the final name ("file
  not found"). The plotter now writes the requested path itself. The output
  directory chain stays locked during the plot; a link or junction at the
  final name is refused; with `overwrite` an existing PDF is moved to a backup
  and restored if the plot fails; after the plot the output must be a regular
  file with one hard link (a link planted during the plot is removed and the
  call fails) before it is verified.
- `civil3d_profile view_create` always failed on Civil 3D 2027 ("ProfileView.Create
  returned null"): the plugin probed `ProfileView.Create` by reflection with
  argument orders that do not exist. It now calls the typed
  `Create(alignmentId, insertPosition, name, bandSetId, styleId)` overload,
  falling back to the drawing's first profile view style and band set when none
  is named. When the drawing has only one of the two, the view is created with
  Civil 3D's defaults, the one that exists is applied to it, and a warning
  names the one that was missing; a named style or band set that cannot be
  applied, or a view that cannot be given the requested name, fails with
  `CIVIL3D.INVALID_INPUT` and nothing is created. New optional `layer`; the
  result reports name, handle, layer, style and band set.
- The profile view band-set lookup read `ProfileViewBandSetStyles` from the
  label-set styles root, where it does not exist, so it always returned a null
  id (`view_band_set` imported nothing). It now reads `Styles.ProfileViewBandSetStyles`.
- A requested layer that did not exist was silently replaced by the current
  layer (e.g. `create_layout layer:"C-ROAD-DES"` landed on layer 0). Missing
  layers are now created; an invalid layer name is `CIVIL3D.INVALID_INPUT`.
  Applies to every create path that takes `layer` (profiles, alignments,
  offset alignments, polylines, text, lines, profile views).
- `civil3d_profile check_k_values` computed K with A as a decimal grade
  difference (0.028) instead of percent (2.8) — a 280 ft curve reported
  K ≈ 9,980 — and always used a metric table, so 50 (mph) required sag 9 /
  crest 4. K is now L / (100·|g2−g1|), checked against the AASHTO
  stopping-sight-distance design K tables in mph (ft/%) or km/h (m/%). New
  optional `speedUnits` (`mph` | `km/h`) defaults from the drawing's length
  unit; speeds between rows use the next higher row (and say so); speeds
  outside the table are `CIVIL3D.INVALID_INPUT`. Per curve it now returns
  grades in percent, A in percent, K, required K, start/end and PVI station.
  A profile with no vertical curves reports `allPass: false` with a warning,
  since nothing was checked.
- `civil3d_profile get` reported symmetric parabolas as `asymmetric_parabola`
  ("parabolasymmetric" contains "asymmetric"); they are now
  `symmetric_parabola`. The response schema still accepts the old `parabola`.
- With no document open, drawing-dependent requests hung and wedged the
  plugin's execution gate; they now fail fast with `CIVIL3D.NO_DRAWING`, and
  `civil3d_drawing new` works from zero documents.
- `civil3d_drawing` `settings` failed response validation on every drawing:
  the plugin reports `defaultStyles.corridor` as `null` unconditionally (Civil
  3D exposes no corridor style collection) and the schema rejected `null`. The
  five `defaultStyles` fields are now `string | null`, with regression tests.
- `docs:check` and `version:check` reported generated files as stale on any
  Windows clone with `core.autocrlf=true`; comparisons now ignore CRLF/LF.

### Added

- Read-only geometry for the Civil 3D-Revit bridge. None of these is
  approval-gated (`query`/`inspect`, `safeForRetry`):
  - `getSurfaceTinVertices` (`civil3d_surface get_tin_vertices`): the vertices
    of a TIN surface's visible triangles (or a grid surface's visible points),
    optionally clipped to a plan polygon. Over `maxPoints` (default 50,000,
    hard cap 100,000) they are decimated deterministically: sorted by X then Y,
    with an even stride. Coordinates are rounded to 6 decimals to keep the
    largest response near 6 MB. TIN volume surfaces are rejected clearly.
  - `getParcelGeometry` (`civil3d_parcel get_geometry`): real parcel boundary
    from the typed curve API (base curve, then `GetGeCurve`, then `Explode`)
    with line/arc segments, bulges, a densified polygon, perimeter and area
    computed including arcs. `reportParcels` still uses its reflection path.
  - `getDrawingUnits` (`civil3d_drawing units`): raw INSUNITS and its name, a
    `lengthUnit` that keeps `USSurveyFeet` distinct from `Feet`, metres per
    unit, the Civil 3D drawing unit settings (Feet/Meters and the
    imperial-to-metric foot), angular units, and a consistency warning when
    INSUNITS and Civil 3D disagree.
  - `getPipeNetwork`/`getPipe` pipes gain `startPoint`, `endPoint`,
    `startInvert`, `endInvert`, `startCrown`, `endCrown`, `innerDiameter`,
    `outerDiameter`, `innerHeight`, `outerHeight`, `wallThickness`,
    `crossSectionalShape` and `length2d` (additive; inverts are centreline
    minus inner height / 2, as in `civil3d_compare`).
  - `getDrawingInfo` and `getCoordinateSystemInfo` gain an additive
    `lengthUnit`; `linearUnits` keeps its old values.
  - Host-independent `BridgeMath.cs` (arcs, bulge areas, chaining,
    point-in-polygon, stride decimation, unit resolution) with an offline
    harness, `npm run test:bridge-math`. Live verification is pending (see
    TESTING.md).
- `civil3d_plot` domain tool (plugin `PlotCommands.cs`): `list_layouts`,
  `list_page_setups`, `list_plotters` (read-only, never approval-gated) and
  `plot_layouts_to_pdf` / `publish_sheet_set` (approval-gated `export`). Plots
  drive `-PLOT` / `-PUBLISH` with `BACKGROUNDPLOT=0` instead of the PlotEngine,
  which live testing found crash-prone from a command context; every answer is
  validated up front, output goes through `FileBoundary` (export roots, `.pdf`,
  directory chain locked while the plotter writes, `overwrite` defaults to
  false), and success is only reported for a non-empty PDF written by the run.
  Both output actions can run as `civil3d_job` operations
  (`plot_layouts_to_pdf`, `publish_sheet_set`) via `asJob: true`. Live
  verification against Civil 3D 2027 is pending (see TESTING.md).
- `CivilExecution.ExecuteCommandSequenceAsync` for host work that issues
  AutoCAD commands; it keeps the zero-document `CIVIL3D.NO_DRAWING` fast fail
  and the drawing-identity check but opens no transaction around the command.
- `civil3d_xref` domain: `list` reports each xref's saved and found paths,
  status (`loaded`, `unloaded`, `unreferenced`, `not_found`, `unresolved`,
  `orphaned`), attach or overlay, nesting and parents, and instance count.
  `attach`, `overlay`, `detach`, `reload`, `unload`, `bind` (`bind`/`insert`)
  and `repath` (`absolute`/`relative`) change xrefs and need approval. Every
  caller path goes through `FileBoundary` (import roots, `.dwg` only, must
  exist). Reload, unload, bind, and detach run under the document lock with no
  enclosing transaction, through the new
  `CivilExecution.ExecuteLockedWithoutTransactionAsync`.
- `civil3d_project data_shortcut_references` (read-only) lists the
  data-shortcut references in the current drawing with source drawing, source
  object name/type/handle, where the source is relative to the working folder
  and current project, and `current`/`out_of_date`/`broken`/`source_missing`/`unknown`
  status, all from `Entity.GetReferenceInfo()` and the `IsReference*` flags.
  `data_shortcut_repair` (needs approval) repoints a reference to a new source
  drawing through `DataShortcuts.RepairBrokenDRef`, resolved at runtime from
  `AeccDataShortcutMgd.dll` through `Civil3DCompatibility`, so the build needs
  no seventh reference.
- `civil3d_compare` domain, which never modifies a drawing. `drawing` compares
  the active drawing with another DWG that it reads as a side database with
  `ReadDwgFile`, never opening it as a document. `snapshot` writes a JSON
  fingerprint to the export roots; it is gated as an export and does not
  overwrite by default. `compare_snapshot` diffs against a snapshot. Results
  group added/removed/modified entities by type and layer and add Civil 3D
  object diffs: alignment length and geometry hash, profile PVIs, surface
  statistics, pipe counts and inverts. The host-independent diff
  (`DrawingFingerprint.cs`) has an offline harness,
  `npm run test:compare-diff`.

### Changed

- `data_shortcut_sync` sends `_AeccSynchronizeReferences`, the command name
  found in the Civil 3D 2027 CUIx and `AeccUiBase.arx`, where it used to send
  `SynchronizeReferences`. `data_shortcut_list` fills `sourceFilePath` from
  `GetReferenceInfo()`.
- `data_shortcut_promote` now finds the reference, preselects it, and queues
  `_AeccPromoteReference`, where it used to only return manual steps.

- Civil 3D 2027 build path: `scripts/gather-refs-2027.ps1` stages the six
  managed references (spread across three folders in a 2027 install) and
  `scripts/build-2027.ps1` builds with a `net10.0-windows` override — Civil 3D
  2027's assemblies target .NET 10 — without changing the 2026 default.
- `scripts/install-bundle.ps1` deploys the plugin as an ApplicationPlugins
  bundle, which auto-loads under the default `SECURELOAD=1` policy that rejects
  Startup Suite entries outside `TRUSTEDPATHS`.

## v1.2.1 — 2026-07-14

### Production readiness

- Added a self-contained Claude Desktop MCPB package, a byte-identical legacy
  DXT compatibility artifact, installer configuration, checksum generation, and
  official manifest validation through `npm run package:claude`.
- Added a compact 33-tool default MCP surface while keeping 216 manifest-backed
  canonical and alias routes available internally; set
  `CIVIL3D_ENABLE_TOOL_ALIASES=true` to expose the full 218-tool MCP surface.
- Added first-class MCP output schemas, structured content, annotations,
  resources, progress notifications, and report-resource retrieval.
- Added parameter-bound, drawing-bound approval receipts, bounded serialized
  host execution, disconnect cancellation, idempotency, and stable errors.
- Added bounded background jobs for publishing, imports, corridor rebuilds, and
  bulk QC, with terminal retention and cancellation telemetry.
- Added liveness, readiness, plugin, queue, and version endpoints on the local
  HTTP bridge at port 3000.
- Added rotating native plugin logs with file-health and last-error telemetry.
- Added CI, generated tool documentation, manifest/dispatcher parity, package
  inspection, startup smoke, and opt-in live Civil 3D host validation.
- Removed tracked Autodesk assemblies; Release builds resolve licensed Civil 3D
  2026 references through `Civil3DReferencesPath`.

### Live validation

- Validated plugin 1.2.1.0 against Civil 3D 2026 on port 8080.
- Validated the spawned stdio MCP client, HTTP registration and routing,
  approvals, concurrency, document switching, create/undo/delete, temporary
  TIN-volume rollback, job cancellation/completion, and response limits.

### AI CoPilot Plugin (C#)

**Command routing (all 150 categories):**
- `IsMcpDirectCommand()` — routes `civil3d_*` and `create_cogo_point` to MCP async handler
- `IsHydrologyCommand()` — routes hydrology commands to async MCP → CAD draw pipeline
- `CommandRouter.Execute()` — synchronous CAD transaction handler for 14 draw command types
- `HandleMcpDirectCommandAsync()` — async MCP caller with formatted JObject result display

**Hydrology integration:**
- `HydrologyDrawer.cs` — draws flow paths (cyan), watershed boundaries (yellow), outlet markers (red)
- `McpClient.cs` — typed async methods for all 5 hydrology tools with result model classes
- Sequential workflow support: `lastHydroOutlet` chains `FindLowPoint` → `DelineateWatershed`

**AI providers supported:** Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic

---

### Integration Tests

- 13 test files, **372 tests**, all passing
- End-to-end workflow tests covering alignment → surface → corridor → profile pipeline
- Hydrology workflow tests covering flow path → low point → watershed → catchment → runoff

---

### Bug Fixes

- **JFS-15**: Fixed structural C# compile error — hydrology methods were accidentally placed outside the `McpClient` class body
- **JFS-15**: Made `ExecuteMcpToolAsync` public (was private) to enable direct MCP command routing

---

### Known Limitations

- Civil 3D API calls require an active drawing session — no headless mode
- Hydrology delineation uses grid sampling (not DEM-optimized); large surfaces may be slow
- C# plugin targets .NET Framework 4.8 (AutoCAD/Civil 3D requirement)

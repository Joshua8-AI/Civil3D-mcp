.SYNOPSIS
  Builds the Civil 3D MCP plugin against staged 2027 references, and optionally
  deploys it as an auto-loading ApplicationPlugins bundle.

.DESCRIPTION
  The csproj targets net8.0-windows for Civil 3D 2026. Civil 3D 2027 ships
  managed assemblies built against .NET 10, which fail CS1705 against a net8.0
  reference set, so this script overrides the target framework on the command
  line instead of editing the csproj -- the repo default stays valid for 2026.

  Run scripts\gather-refs-2027.ps1 first to stage the six Autodesk references.

  -Install deploys via scripts\install-bundle.ps1. Bundles under
  ApplicationPlugins are implicitly trusted and auto-load, which the APPLOAD
  Startup Suite cannot do while SECURELOAD=1 and TRUSTEDPATHS is empty.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\build-2027.ps1 -Install
